I intend to use this website as:

- a personal blog.
- a place to store technical learnings so that I can re-visit them in the future.

I have used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to generate this website and will likely experiment with different pre-built [themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/).

## TODOs

### Added on 2024-11-26

- [ ] Have a `Created on` and `Last updated on` fields in `single.html` file to track the updates.
- [ ] Add a `Recipes` section to the website.
